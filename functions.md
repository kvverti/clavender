# Functions
Functions are one of the basic building blocks of Lavender programs. In fact,
a Lavender program is nothing more than the evaluation of functions, either
built in or user-defined.

## Defining Functions
Functions are declared with the `def` keyword. If a function is defined at top
level, it may be accessed using its qualified name, while functions defined within
other functions (nested functions) are only accessible directly via their simple name within
their enclosing function.
